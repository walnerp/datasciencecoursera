#Project Description

This project is part of the Getting and Cleaning Data course from Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.org.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

Study design and data processing

##Collection of the raw data

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

Notes on the original (raw) data

For each record in the dataset it is provided:

Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
Its activity label.
An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
Creating the tidy datafile

Guide to create the tidy data files

##The tidy data file was created by doing the following:

Merged training and test sets to create on data set:
Downloaded data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
Unzipped file: creates UCI HAR Dataset folder with all untidy data and files
Read and merged train and test for activity, data, and subject:
Read and merged activity files: y_train.txt and y_test.txt into data_activity_all
Read and merged data files: x_train.txt and x_test.txt into data_observed_all
Read and merged subject files: subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt into data_subject_all
Read data from features.txt into features_names
Replaced the variable (column) names of data_observed_all using data 2nd column of features_names
Merged data_subject_all, data_activity_all, and data_observed_all into data_all
Extracted measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement:
Extracted rows from features_names that contained word mean or std
Combined them into data_mean_std
Extracted columns from data_all corresponding to subject (col1) and activity (col2) as well as columns containing mean or std (data_mean_std)
Stored new table into data_table
Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:
Read activity_labels.txt to extract activity descriptions (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, and LAYING) into activity_labels
Replaced each activity code (1,2,...,6) from data_table with the corresponding activity label from activity_labels
Changed the variable name activity_code (2nd column) to activity
Labeled the data set with descriptive variable names:
Subset all columns corresponding to observed variables, excluding subject and activity, into data_table1
Substituted all the observed abbreviations in the variables of data_table1 for its corresponding full word:
"t" for "time"
"f" for "frequency"
"Acc" for "accelerometer"
etc.
Merged again the modified data_table1 and the first 2 columns of data_table
Removed data_table1 as it was temporary
Saved these data into a new file tidy_data_table_1.txt
Created a second tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject:
Aggregated subject + activity and applied mean
Saved these data into a new file tidy_data_table_2.txt
Cleaning of the data

##The data cleaning process has created 2 data sets:

tidy_data_table_1.txt contains all data observations on all the variables corresponding to a mean or standard deviation with subject and activity details in the first 2 columns
tidy_data_table_2.txt contains the previous data but grouped by subject (30 subjects) and activity (6 activities).
Subject 1 WALKING
Subject 1 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
...
Subject 2 WALKING
...
Subject 30 LAYING
Description of the variables in the tidy_data_table_1.txt file
